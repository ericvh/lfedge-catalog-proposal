# LFEdge Catalog Proposal

Catalog of LFEdge demos and stacks.

SMARTER example is documented [here](SMARTER_example.md)

Original idea documented [on LFEdge wiki](https://wiki.lfedge.org/display/LE/LF+Edge+Catalog)

## Tutorial

In this proposal we explored two different modes of deployment selecting helm charts for kubernetes based deployments as the primary way to deploy applications.
Terraform is an additional tool that is used to simplify infrastructure management primarily of cloud resources (AWS, GCE, Azure, etc.)

### Getting Started

If you don't already have a kubernetes cluster, we suggest installing Docker Desktop which seems to provide the easiest and most uniform environment across Mac, Windows, and Linux.

- Go to <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/> and install docker desktop for your platform
- Once it is installed, open it's preferences and enable Kubernetes support:

![Docker Preferences Pane](files/docker-pref.png)

- Wait for kubernetes to install and come up, the kubernetes icon on the bottom of the Docker Desktop should be green
- Open a shell to test the kubernetes installation
- Verify kubernetes is running and configured properly:

```console
$ kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443
CoreDNS is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use kubectl cluster-info dump.
```

### Your first helm chart

You can create a simple helm chart using the helm command:

```console
$ helm create hello
Creating hello
$ ls hello
Chart.yaml      charts          templates       values.yaml
```

The starter chart is a simple NGINX deployment.  The metadata for the chart is in _Chart.yaml_ with customization variables in _values.yaml_, the underlying templates which will create the kubernetes yaml files are in the _templates_ sub-directory.  For more information on Helm charts, simply read the [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs).

To deploy this simple chart, you need to just provide it a name.  As a convenience we'll customize it from the command line to use the _LoadBalancer_ service.type which makes it easier to access the results from your local web browser.  We could have also made this customization by editing values.yaml.

```console
$ helm install --set service.type=LoadBalancer example hello
NAME: example
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Oct 23 11:20:58 2022
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
     NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
           You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get --namespace default svc -w example-hello'
  export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default example-hello --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{.}}{{ end }}")
  echo http://$SERVICE_IP:80
```

In most cases, SERVICE_IP should just be localhost, so once the helm chart finishes installing you should be able to access the resulting web page by pointing your web browser at <http://localhost>

When you are done, you can uninstall the chart via the command line to cleanup:

```console
$ helm uninstall example
release "example" uninstalled
```

### Creating custom templates and parameters

If you look at the contents of the simple values.yaml file, you'll see there are quite a few customization options and it can be a bit overwhelming.  What we want to create is a much more approachable configuration by using a simple chart which only allows us to customize the content.  We'll do this by creating a second chart, have it reference the bitnami NGINX chart as a dependency, and then create a template for a configmap to provide the content based on values from _values.yaml_.

- Create a new starter chart, remove the starter templates and starter values

```console
$ helm create hello2
Creating hello2
$ rm -rf hello2/templates/*
$ echo > hello2/values.yaml
```

- specify a dependency on the bitnami NGINX chart and download the packaged version into _charts_

```console
$ cat <<EOF >> hello2/Chart.yaml
dependencies:
- name: nginx
  repository: "https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami/nginx"
  version: 13.2.11
EOF
$ helm dependency build hello2 
Getting updates for unmanaged Helm repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami/nginx" chart repository
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "bitnami" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
Saving 1 charts
Downloading nginx from repo https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami/nginx
Deleting outdated charts
```

- Now add a template for the customized content to the templates, and an initial custom value to values.yaml

```console
$ cat <<EOF > hello2/templates/configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: hello-configmap
data: 
  index.html: |
    <html>
    <body>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <P>{{ .Values.content }}</P>
    </body>
    </html>
EOF
```

- Finally customize values.yaml to add the content and configure the NGINX dependency to use that configmap:

```console
$ cat <<EOF > hello2/values.yaml
content: "Hello, World!"
nginx:
  staticSiteConfigmap: hello-configmap
EOF
```

- Try out your new chart

```console
$ helm install --set nginx.service.type=LoadBalancer example hello2
NAME: example
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Oct 23 12:09:51 2022
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

- Open up your browser again

![NGINX Dependency in Browser](files/nginx-depend.png)

- Update the message from the command line

```console
$ helm upgrade --set nginx.service.type=LoadBalancer --set content="Hello LFEdge" example hello2
NAME: example
LAST DEPLOYED: Sun Oct 23 12:09:51 2022
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

- Reopen your browser (and beware cached content, you may have to force reload)
- For more information on helm templates, follow the [Helm Template Tutorial](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/)
- If you are going to push your package to artifacthub.io (covered later in the tutorial), you should add a README.md to the chart directory and update Chart.yaml with artifact-hub specific metadata.  Its a good idea to provide quickstart instructions, quick configure instructions, as well as long-form parameter lists in your README.md.

### Packaging and Publishing your helm charts

The easiest way to publish helm charts is to use a web site, you can even serve them from a subdirectory of an existing website.
We'll use a github pages project to serve the pages, but you can easily adapt this technique to another type of web host.

- Start by packaging the two helm charts we just created

```console
$ helm package hello
Successfully packaged chart and save
$ helm package hello2
```

(if you have a PGP key, go ahead and sign them by adding --sign)

```console
$ helm package --sign --key ericvh@gmail.com --keyring ~/.gnupg/secring.gpg hello
Password for key "Eric Van Hensbergen <ericvh@gmail.com>" >  
Successfully packaged chart and saved it to: /Users/erivan01/src/lfedge-catalog-proposal/examples/hello-0.1.0.tgz
```

- Create a new github project, populate it with a default README.md
- Go back to the github project settings (<https://github.com/user/project/settings/pages>) and setup pages by selecting the main branch and /root then click save

![GitHub pages setup](files/github-pages-setup.png)

- Checkout the github project to your system and add the packaged charts

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:ericvh/lfedge-catalog.git # replace with your repo
Cloning into 'lfedge-catalog'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 26, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (26/26), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (22/22), done.
remote: Total 26 (delta 1), reused 23 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (26/26), 36.98 KiB | 425.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
$ mv *.tgz* lfedge-catalog
```

- create the index for the packaged charts (creating an index.yaml)

```console
helm repo index --url https://ericvh.github.io/lfedge-catalog lfedge-catalog
```

- add the new files, commit, and push back to gitlab

```console
$ cd lfedge-catalog
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Add charts'
[main b80030d] Add charts
 5 files changed, 91 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 hello-0.1.0.tgz
 create mode 100644 hello-0.1.0.tgz.prov
 create mode 100644 hello2-0.1.0.tgz
 create mode 100644 hello2-0.1.0.tgz.prov
 create mode 100644 index.yaml
$ git push 
```

- Wait about a minute and then check to make sure the index.yaml is there: <https://ericvh.github.io/lfedge-catalog/index.yaml>

![GitHub index.yaml](files/index-yaml.png)

- Its also a good idea to add instructions to your Github pages README.md about how to access the charts:

```console
$ cat <<EOF > README.md
# lfedge-catalog

To use this catalog:

- helm repo add lfedge https://ericvh.github.io/lfedge-catalog
- helm update
EOF
$ git commit -a -m "Update README.md"
main b1f9470] Update README.md
 1 file changed, 9 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
$ git push
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 10 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 1.01 KiB | 1.01 MiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
To github.com:ericvh/t2.git
   b80030d..b1f9470  main -> main
```

- Any time you update or release your charts, just update the web page by adding to the git repo, re-indexing, and pushing.

## Adding charts to Artifacthub

Artifacthub acts as an index of many different types of resources including Helm charts.

- Go to <https://artifacthub.io> and setup a new user if you don't already have an account
- Click on your profile picture in the upper right hand corner and select control panel
- Click the Add button to add a new repository
- Give your repository a name, and point it at your github page you just created: <https://ericvh.github.io/lfedge-catalog>
- After a period of time (usually 15 minutes to a half an hour, it will scrape your charts and add them), then you can search for your packages and see them in the repo
- Follow artifacthub documentation to [add metadata](https://artifacthub.io/docs/topics/annotations/helm/), [prove ownership](https://artifacthub.io/docs/topics/repositories/), and add readme content to your package by including a README.md inside the package directory prior to its packaging.
